Here's how buy function can be divided into levels of difficulty so you can progressively build and understand it:
---

### **Level 1: Basic Structure**
- Focus on the basic `GET` and `POST` handling.
- Display a simple form to input the stock symbol and number of shares.
- Validate if the inputs are provided.
#### Tasks:
1. Handle `GET` requests to display the `buy.html` form.
2. Handle `POST` requests to retrieve `symbol` and `shares` from the form.
3. Check if `symbol` or `shares` are empty and display an error.

---

### **Level 2: Stock Symbol Validation**
- Add logic to check if the stock symbol is valid.
- Use a mock function like `lookup()` to simulate stock data retrieval.
#### Tasks:
1. Use a helper function `lookup(symbol)` to get stock data.
   - Mock it for now (e.g., return a dictionary with `price` and `name` if valid).
2. Check if the stock symbol exists.
   - If not, display an appropriate error message.

---

### **Level 3: Shares Validation**
- Validate the `shares` input to ensure it is a positive integer.
#### Tasks:
1. Check if `shares` is numeric.
2. Ensure `shares > 0`.
3. Display an error if validation fails.

---

### **Level 4: Calculate Transaction Value**
- Calculate the total cost of the transaction based on the number of shares and the stock price.
#### Tasks:
1. Retrieve the stock price from the `lookup` function.
2. Multiply `shares` by the stock price to calculate the transaction value.
3. Print or log the transaction value to verify calculations.

---

### **Level 5: Check User's Balance**
- Retrieve the user’s current cash balance from the database.
- Check if the user has enough funds to make the purchase.

#### Tasks:
1. Query the `users` table to get the user's cash balance.
2. Compare the user's balance with the transaction value.
3. Display an error if the user does not have enough money.

---

### **Level 6: Update Database**
- Update the database to reflect the purchase.
- Deduct the transaction value from the user’s cash.
- Add the purchase to the `transactions` table.

#### Tasks:
1. Update the `users` table to deduct the cash.
2. Insert a new record into the `transactions` table.
3. Ensure all queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection.

---

### **Level 7: Add Confirmation and Redirection**
- Display a success message and redirect the user to the homepage.

#### Tasks:
1. Use `flash()` to show a success message.
2. Redirect the user to the homepage (`/`).

---

### **Level 8: Handle Errors Gracefully**
- Add error handling for:
   - Missing or invalid stock data.
   - Database query errors.
   - Unexpected issues (e.g., network problems).

#### Tasks:
1. Wrap the database and stock lookup logic in `try-except` blocks.
2. Display a generic error message if something unexpected occurs.
